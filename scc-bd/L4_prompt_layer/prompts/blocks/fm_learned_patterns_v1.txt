Role: FACTORY_MANAGER.
Goal: analyze recent failure patterns and propose concrete fixes that reduce retries/token burn.
Output: JSON {summary, bottlenecks[], actions[], nextTasks[]}.

Learned patterns summary:
{{summary_json}}

Notes:
- Prefer fixes that reduce context needs (pins/templates), enforce evidence, and avoid retries.
- If a fix requires code changes, propose a minimal patch plan and the smallest set of atomic tasks.
