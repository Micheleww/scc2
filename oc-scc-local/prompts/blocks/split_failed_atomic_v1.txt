As DESIGNER: decompose the following FAILED atomic task into <=10 minute atomic subtasks.

FAILED TASK ID: {{task_id}}
FAILED TITLE: {{task_title}}
FAILED ROLE: {{task_role}}
FAILED GOAL:
{{task_goal}}

FAILED REASON: {{failed_reason}}

Constraints:
- Output MUST be a JSON array (no prose outside JSON).
- Each subtask MUST include: title, goal, role, skills, pointers, files, allowedExecutors, allowedModels, runner, status.
- Keep each subtask runnable without scanning repo: use pointers/docs + small file lists.
- Prefer splitting by file/module and by independent acceptance tests.
