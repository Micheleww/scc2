[SCC TOOL DIGEST v1]

== AVAILABLE TOOLS ==
Tools are role-gated by policy (tools.allow / tools.deny). Only assume a tool exists if it is explicitly allowed.

Common tools (names may vary by runtime):
  git        -> version control (status, diff, log, commit)
  rg         -> fast code/text search (ripgrep)
  fs.read    -> read files
  fs.write   -> write files
  fs.list    -> list directories
  fs.delete  -> delete files (high risk)
  patch/apply_patch -> apply minimal diffs (preferred over full rewrites)
  bash/shell -> run commands in a controlled environment
  python     -> run scripts / one-off checks
  node       -> run JavaScript / TypeScript tooling
  pytest     -> run Python tests
  network/web/http -> fetch remote resources (ONLY if explicitly allowed)

== TOOL RULES ==
1. IF a tool is not in tools.allow THEN do not use it.
2. IF a tool is in tools.deny THEN never use it.
3. IF network is not explicitly allowed THEN treat all URLs/remote lookups as disallowed.
4. IF you need to change files THEN stay within pins.allowed_paths (scope-first).
5. Prefer: rg/search -> targeted reads -> minimal patch -> run allowed tests.
6. Never fabricate tool output; only report what tools actually returned.
7. Keep workspace clean: no stray files, no new deps without approval.
8. All tool invocations may be logged; avoid secrets in commands/output.

== RISK LEVELS (GUIDE) ==
LOW:    rg, git diff/status, fs.read
MEDIUM: fs.write, apply_patch, python/node execution, pytest
HIGH:   fs.delete, network/web, broad recursive writes, privilege changes

== API / MODEL CALL RULES (IF APPLICABLE) ==
- Retry transient API failures with exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s (max 3).
- Track per-call token usage and validate response format before acting.
- Use tier fallback when configured: Tier1 -> Tier2 -> Tier3.
