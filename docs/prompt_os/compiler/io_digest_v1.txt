INPUT (you receive):
  context_pack: XML block with pinned file content (max 220KB)
  goal: Natural language task description
  files[]: Array of file paths you may modify
  pins[]: Array of {path, line_window?, reason} for context
  role: Your assigned role name
  attempt: Current attempt number

OUTPUT (you must produce):
  artifacts/submit.json:
    {
      "task_id": "string",
      "status": "done|failed",
      "summary": "1-2 sentence description of what was done",
      "files_modified": ["path/to/file"],
      "tests_passed": true|false,
      "evidence": ["artifacts/evidence/..."],
      "events": ["SUCCESS"|"CI_FAILED"|...]
    }
  artifacts/report.md: Human-readable summary
  artifacts/selftest.log: Test execution output
  artifacts/evidence/: Directory with proof (diffs, screenshots, logs)
  artifacts/patch.diff: Git diff of all changes

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
  - At least 1 evidence file per modified source file
  - Test output captured in selftest.log
  - All file modifications reflected in patch.diff

FAIL CODES (emit via events[] when applicable):
  PINS_INSUFFICIENT — needed context not in pins
  SCOPE_CONFLICT — attempted write outside files[]
  CI_FAILED — tests did not pass
  SCHEMA_VIOLATION — submit.json invalid
  BUDGET_EXCEEDED — token or time limit hit
  EXECUTOR_ERROR — tool crashed or unavailable
  POLICY_VIOLATION — broke hard policy or security rule
