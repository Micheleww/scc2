Context: This ADR intentionally is not linked from docs/INDEX.md to demonstrate the CI fixup-loop behavior.
Decision: Add a minimal v2 ADR entry file that satisfies the template fields while keeping the missing index link intentional.
Alternatives: Update docs/INDEX.md or rename the ADR, but both would defeat the purpose of the demo.
Consequences: CI/doc tooling may report an unindexed ADR until a follow-up change is made to add the link.
Migration: No migration is required because this change is documentation-only and does not affect runtime behavior.
Owner: scc-ci-demo.
