Context: SCC needs a deterministic, auditable repository index to reduce pins churn and SSOT drift.
Decision: Introduce Map v1 as a code-generated structured index (map/map.json + map/version.json + map/link_report.json) with a query interface and CI gate.
Alternatives: (1) LLM-only pins discovery (unstable, non-auditable), (2) manual SSOT curation without computed index (drift-prone), (3) full semantic indexing upfront (too costly).
Consequences: Map becomes the facts substrate for pins/preflight/SSOT gates; link_report enables DocLink Gate; schema/version/hash enables replayability and audit.
Migration: Start with JSON-only Map v1; later add optional SQLite/incremental optimizations and semantic suggestions as non-authoritative hints.
